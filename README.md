### ‚ú¶ About Me

I‚Äôm a **Web & UX/UI designer + Front-End Developer** who loves creating modern, experimental visuals. With knowledge of HTML/CSS & an eye for interactive experiences, I design interfaces that are functional & accessible yet immersive ‚Äî with playful touches like glassmorphism, dynamic gradients, & subtle motion that bring projects to life.  

‚Äú**TaaraNova**‚Äù was born from a fascination with supernovas ‚Äî cosmic bursts of light that mark both an ending & the beginning of something entirely new.  
Just like a star‚Äôs eruption creates the building blocks for new worlds, I see design as an ever-evolving process of transformation, experimentation, & renewal.  

The name plays on *terra nova* (‚Äúnew world‚Äù) & *supernova*, but with **taara (‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ/ÿ™ÿßÿ±ÿß)** ‚Äî the Hindi/Urdu word for ‚Äústar‚Äù ‚Äî at its core, becoming ‚Äúnew star.‚Äù It reflects my cultural roots, curiosity for the unknown, & drive to create work that feels both luminous & grounded.  

Like the starburst behind the name, my career is just beginning ‚Äî but I‚Äôm always pushing into bigger, brighter territory.
